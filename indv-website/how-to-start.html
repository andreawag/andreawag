        <h2>HOW TO START</h2>
        <img class="paint" src="../indv-website/images/bunch.png" alt="Bunch" style="width: 500px;600px;">
        <p>A question I am frequently being asked is how to start channeling creativity. Speaking from my own personal experiences, I forst started by trying a bunch of new things. I started painting with a bunch of different mediums before I found one I really loved, watercolor. I also tried skecthing, sculpting, and many more. Through this creative journey I found my sweet spot. A love for calligraphy/hand lettering and a love for watercolor. I felt proud of the things I had made and wanted to contine practicing and improving. </p>
        <img class="brush" src="../indv-website/images/brushes.jpg" alt="Brushes" style="width: 300px;400px;"> 
        <p>It is very easy to start comparing your work to the work and progress of others, especially when looking at others social media accounts, portfolios, and art work. But I advise anyone trying to find their own creativity to steer clear of those things! It is fine to use others creations as forms of inspiration, but mimicking and copying will not get you anywhre. Trust me. You have to put in the time and effort to make something original that you can call your own. </p>
