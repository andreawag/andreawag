        <h2>PURPOSE</h2>
        <img class="paint" src="../paintbrush.jpg" alt="Painting" style="width: 500px;600px;">
        <p>I recieve a lot of questions about the purpose of my buisness and what it brings into my life. My purpose for creating this site and creating my artwork is purely beacuse I love doing it. I do not desire to gain anything but joy from this site and from creating.</p>
        <p>I first started this art journey right after I graduated from high school. I found it very theraputic for me and it helped me go through some major obstacles in my life. I also felt that I could create things I was proud of and that could help inspire people to tap into their creative side.</p>

    <img class="colors" src="../colors.jpg" alt="Paint Colors" style="width: 400px;300px;">
    <p>I want people to be able to learn and grow within their own personal creativity through this site. I thoroughly enjoy sharing my experiences and helping those along their creative journey.</p>
