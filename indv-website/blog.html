        <h2>THE CREATIVE PROCESS</h2>
        <p>What is Creativity? How can I become a creative person? I don’t have natural talent; how can I make something beautiful? I have a one-word answer for these questions. Practice. 
Every creative person begins by making something they don’t really love. Or even like. But it is the persistence and dedication that changes their work and their selves. 

I would like to share with you my process of creation. The example I am going to be using today is my work on a painting. The paining is a beautiful building with a flower wreath placed on the bottom. With pictures and videos, I will help you see into my creative process, in order to help you figure out yours.</p> 
<!--place first image-->
<p>This is the first picture of my process and the first foundation of my building. I honestly, at first did not love how it looked, but I let it dry and then continued on.</p>
<!--place second image-->
<p>This is the second stage of my painting. I liked it a whole lot more at this point, after adding lots of messy details.</p> 
<!--place practice video-->
<p>The next step I took was not on the painting, but a practice round for the flowers I was going to put on the bottom. I find that practicing steps before you put them on the final draft is essential! It helps you to warm up and get into the groove.</p> 
<!--place second video-->
<p>Then I got brave and finally decided to paint the flowers on my final draft. Even though I was nervous to mess up all my work, I knew I needed to take the risk! I also felt better after practicing.</p>

 <!--place final image-->           
<p>The final product! Through this creative process, I was able to make something I am proud to call my own. You can do the same with any creative process you can imagine! All it takes are some risks, some failures, lots of practice, and time. You will hopefully find something you love and create things you love.</p>
