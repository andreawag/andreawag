        <br>
            <p>Below I have written out my own personal experience in finding creativity and using it as a postivie outlet.</p>
        <h2>THE BEGINNING</h2>
        <p>The first steps to art and creativity aren't always pretty. When I first began to draw and paint, I was not pleased with the finished product. I felt that I didn't have the skill to appropriately convey my vision on paper. And that is completely normal! Most artists ( especially extremely talented and practiced artists) hardly ever feel that their work is an exact replica of what they had first envisioned.</p>
        <p>It takes time and pratcice to hone in on your personal skills and find your style. One thing that was helpful to me at first, was to base my paintings off of some I had seen done by ohers. But once I gained some basic skills, I veered off on my own to discover my personal style and gain originality. This is an extremely important step for new artists because it determines you are not just a copier, but your own kind of artist.  </p>
